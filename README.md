Code for Master's thesis in Artificial Intelligence

Python Scripts for univariate (runCNND_Basic, CNN2d_Basic) versus multivariate connectivity predictions (runCNNd_multivar, CNNd_multivar). With regard to multivariate predictions, the current code can currently be run with two or three predictors (by uncommenting 'X2') and this can be extended. In the code itself, information regarding the amount of predictors is provided.
